#About Me
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects including full Stack E-Commerce web Application â€” exploring innovative solutions in web development with JavaScript and modern frameworks.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning TypeScript, React Hooks, and full-stack architecture to strengthen my foundation and build scalable apps.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to frontend performance, web animations, and developer tooling.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, React, DOM animations (GSAP), stock-market web apps, and clean code practices â€” I enjoy discussing how to build efficient, maintainable systems.
